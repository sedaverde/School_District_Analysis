# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The intent of this project was to calculate descriptive statistics of math and reading scores data provided bythe district. This anaylsis included an overview of the complete district's data (average scores, percentage scores, total number of students, total budget, and total schools). The data is broken down further into different categories including:

- school size
- school type
- funding
- grade level

After the inital analysis was performed, it was determined that the data received for the 9th grade class of one of the schools was possibly fabricated. A second analysis was performed with the erroneous information removed from the dataset.
