# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The intent of this project was to calculate descriptive statistics of math and reading scores data provided bythe district. This anaylsis included an overview of the complete district's data (average scores, percentage scores, total number of students, total budget, and total schools). The data is broken down further into different categories including:

- school size
- school type
- funding
- grade level

After the inital analysis was performed, it was determined that the data received for the 9th grade class of one of the schools was possibly fabricated. A second analysis was performed with the erroneous information removed from the dataset.

## Results
How is the district summary affected?

  The following changes were seen once Thomas High School 9th grade data was omited from the analysis
    - Average math score decreased by 0.1%
    - Passing math percentage decreased by 0.2%
    - Passing reading percentage decreased by 0.3%
    - Overall passing percentage decreased by 0.1%

How is the school summary affected?
  The majority of statistics saw  small decrease. Additional statistical analysis would be required in order to prove that the changes wwere negligble.
  
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

  While the individual statistics change slightly, the overall passing percentage does not change enough to affect Thomas High School's standing in comparison to other schools.
   
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
    Math and reading scores by grade are unaffected as the data is sepearated by grade and school name. Thomas High School scores for the 9th grade are omitted.
  - Scores by school spending
    Scores by school spending remain unchanged.
