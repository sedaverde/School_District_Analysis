# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The intent of this project was to calculate descriptive statistics of math and reading scores data provided bythe district. This anaylsis included an overview of the complete district's data (average scores, percentage scores, total number of students, total budget, and total schools). The data is broken down further into different categories including:

- school size
- school type
- funding
- grade level

After the inital analysis was performed, it was determined that the data received for the 9th grade class of one of the schools was possibly fabricated. A second analysis was performed with the erroneous information removed from the dataset.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type
Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
